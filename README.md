# Flipkart-clone
this project is a full-fledged e-commerce website resembling Flipkart, built using a modern and scalable technology stack. It empowers users to browse a catalog of products, add them to their carts, and seamlessly complete purchases through a secure payment gateway.
Key Features:

Product Catalog: Dynamically showcases a collection of products, potentially fetching data from a MongoDB database.
User Interface: Utilizes React to create a user-friendly and responsive interface, ensuring a smooth experience across different devices.
Cart Management: Implements Redux for efficient state management, enabling users to add, remove, and update items in their shopping carts.

Payment Gateway Integration: Integrates Razorpay's payment API to enable secure online payments.
Order Management (Optional): Optionally, implement an order management system to track purchase history, view order details, and manage returns or exchanges (if applicable).
Technologies Used:

Frontend: React for building the user interface.
State Management: Redux for managing application state.
Backend: Express for creating a RESTful API server.
Database: MongoDB for storing product data (and potentially user data, depending on features).
Payment Gateway: Razorpay for secure payment processing.
